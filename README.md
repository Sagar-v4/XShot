# XShot üì∏

Create perfect, clean, and customizable snapshots of X(Twitter) posts in one click.

## Motivation

Sharing X(tweeter) post on other platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, or in news articles is a common practice. However, simply taking a screenshot often results in a low-quality, cluttered, and poorly-sized image. It includes unnecessary UI elements, uses relative timestamps (e.g., "1h ago"), and doesn't adapt well to different platform dimensions.

XShot was built to solve these problems by providing a seamless, one-click tool to generate beautiful and professional-looking tweet snapshots right from your browser.

## The Problem and The Solution

### The Problem üò†

- **Awkward Dimensions:** A standard screenshot of a tweet looks terrible in an Instagram Story or a square post.
- **Imprecise Timestamps:** "2h ago" is useless for archival or news purposes. You need the exact date and time.
- **UI Clutter:** Screenshots capture likes, replies, subscribe buttons, and other distracting UI elements.
- **Inconsistent Themes:** The screenshot theme might not match the content you're creating.

### The Solution: XShot ‚ú®

XShot is a browser extension that integrates directly into the X/Twitter UI.

- **One-Click Capture:** A "Create Snapshot" button is added directly to each tweet's "More" (...) menu.
- **Powerful Editor:** Clicking the button opens a local editor tab where you can customize the snapshot.
- **Perfect Dimensions:** Choose from presets for different platforms like Instagram Post (1:1), Instagram Story (9:16), or YouTube Thumbnail (16:9). The aspect ratio is always maintained perfectly without distortion.
- **Clean & Accurate:** The snapshot only includes the essential parts of the tweet‚Äîname, handle, text, media, and the **exact timestamp**. No clutter.
- **Light, Dim & Dark Themes:** Choose the theme that best fits your brand or content.
